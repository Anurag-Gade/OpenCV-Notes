# OpenCV-Notes (In Progress)

**Overview** 
------------------------
OpenCV, or Open Source Computer Vision is a library which is aimed at Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Image Processing. This library was written in C/C++, and was developed by Intel. Despite of it being written in C++, OpenCV has bindings in Python, Java, and MATLAB. In this repository I will be using Python.

This repository would be an attempt for one to acquire a basic command of OpenCV. In this repository, there is theory followed by the implementation on the Google Colab terminal and the Jupyter Notebook snippets (I have used Jupyter, as in a few instances Colab was crashing).

**Prerequisites**
-----------------------
1) A decent grasp of Python
2) Understanding of Deep Learning (Only for Sections x and y)

And that's it!
